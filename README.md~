# About this repo
For more information how to run the packages checkout my work log:
https://ims.ut.ee/mediawiki/index.php/Secure:Pavel_worklog

youbot_trajectory_plotter typos in youbot_trajecotry_plotter.py fixed (now it is "youbot_trajectory_plotter.py"). Also same typos in the README file are fixed
youbot_network_estopper at the moment kills the youbot driver (for now safest solution)
youbot_move is still under development, it will be used either with leap motion or voice control of the youbot
